00:02:49,165 --> 00:02:49,204


218
00:02:49,205 --> 00:02:51,062
future in the computing world.

219
00:02:51,062 --> 00:02:51,213


220
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,166
Our journey doesnt end here.

221
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:53,285


222
00:02:53,285 --> 00:02:54,782
We have grand plans for the

223
00:02:54,782 --> 00:02:54,812


224
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:55,388
future.

225
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:55,556


226
00:02:55,556 --> 00:02:57,373
We aim to convert our RISCV

227
00:02:57,373 --> 00:02:57,428


228
00:02:57,429 --> 00:02:59,246
processor into a system on

229
00:02:59,246 --> 00:02:59,285


230
00:02:59,285 --> 00:03:01,078
chip, a single integrated

231
00:03:01,078 --> 00:03:01,141


232
00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:02,214
circuit that can perform

233
00:03:02,214 --> 00:03:02,309


234
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:03,854
all the functions of a computer

235
00:03:03,854 --> 00:03:03,909


236
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:04,462
system.

237
00:03:04,462 --> 00:03:04,613


238
00:03:04,613 --> 00:03:06,214
But were not stopping there

239
00:03:06,214 --> 00:03:06,349


240
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:08,046
were also developing an online

241
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:08,125


242
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,910
simulator that will be accessible

243
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,957


244
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:11,164
to the whole world.

245
00:03:11,164 --> 00:03:11,309


246
00:03:11,309 --> 00:03:12,664
This will allow everyone

247
00:03:12,664 --> 00:03:12,758


248
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:14,647
from students to professionals,

249
00:03:14,647 --> 00:03:14,750


250
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:16,440
to test our product and

251
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:16,487


252
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,656
experience its power

253
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:17,735


254
00:03:17,735 --> 00:03:18,704
firsthand.

255
00:03:18,704 --> 00:03:18,839


256
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:20,680
So join us as we continue

257
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:20,767


258
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:21,888
to push the boundaries of

259
00:03:21,888 --> 00:03:21,911


260
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:23,584
what's possible in computing,

261
00:03:23,584 --> 00:03:23,719


262
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,336
and together we can shape

263
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:25,375


264
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,456
the future of this industry.
