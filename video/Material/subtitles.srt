00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,582
 Welcome to the world and

2
00:00:01,598 --> 00:00:03,214
 the awe inspiring realm of

3
00:00:03,254 --> 00:00:04,594
 hardware acceleration,

4
00:00:05,054 --> 00:00:06,726
 a universe where innovation

5
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,414
 is limitless and holds no

6
00:00:08,454 --> 00:00:09,246
 boundaries.

7
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,822
 We ventured into crafting

8
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:12,726
 a groundbreaking RISC V

9
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,326
 processor armed with a

10
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,886
 matrix Mac unit.

11
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,470
 Stepping into the arena with

12
00:00:17,502 --> 00:00:19,078
 powerhouses like Tesla,

13
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:20,982
 Firepro and Intel,

14
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:22,406
 each fuelling innovation

15
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,342
 in its own distinctive manner.

16
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:26,014
 Ponder upon the autonomous

17
00:00:26,054 --> 00:00:26,742
 vehicle.

18
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:28,390
 An extraordinary marvel of

19
00:00:28,422 --> 00:00:29,904
 this vehicle with its state

20
00:00:29,944 --> 00:00:31,824
 of the art cameras and sensors,

21
00:00:31,944 --> 00:00:33,568
 identifies obstructions,

22
00:00:33,696 --> 00:00:35,168
 tracks its surroundings,

23
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:36,888
 and guarantees secure

24
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:37,840
 transit.

25
00:00:38,032 --> 00:00:39,432
 It stands as a compelling

26
00:00:39,488 --> 00:00:40,904
 testament to the vast and

27
00:00:40,944 --> 00:00:42,504
 limitless potential of hardware

28
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:44,016
 acceleration in practical

29
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,964
 applications.

30
00:00:45,464 --> 00:00:46,936
 Inside the Tesla Giga

31
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,472
 factory, we catch a glimpse

32
00:00:48,488 --> 00:00:50,000
 of an advanced world taking

33
00:00:50,072 --> 00:00:50,672
 shape.

34
00:00:50,808 --> 00:00:52,272
 From self driving vehicles

35
00:00:52,328 --> 00:00:54,200
 to humanoid robots, video,

36
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,808
 and AI driven autonomous

37
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,724
 entities, the need for hardware

38
00:00:57,764 --> 00:00:59,436
 accelerators like RISC five

39
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,276
 processors is more palpable

40
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,264
 than ever.

41
00:01:02,644 --> 00:01:04,468
 What does the future of computing

42
00:01:04,516 --> 00:01:05,292
 look like?

43
00:01:05,428 --> 00:01:07,100
 Its guided by a RISC five

44
00:01:07,172 --> 00:01:09,060
 matrix Mac processor, an

45
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:10,300
 extraordinary innovation

46
00:01:10,372 --> 00:01:12,076
 beyond the usual chip

47
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,196
 implemented on an FPGA.

48
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,052
 It manages structure, control,

49
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:17,628
 and data hazards with new

50
00:01:17,676 --> 00:01:18,556
 techniques.

51
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,660
 Our processor deftly navigates

52
00:01:20,732 --> 00:01:21,756
 through these hazards.

53
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,340
 Its a symphony of efficiency

54
00:01:23,372 --> 00:01:24,144
 and performance.

55
00:01:24,874 --> 00:01:26,346
 Moving from the processor,

56
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:27,610
 we journey into the domain

57
00:01:27,642 --> 00:01:29,530
 of the urat transceiver,

58
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:31,218
 a marvel built by our very

59
00:01:31,266 --> 00:01:32,010
 own hands.

60
00:01:32,082 --> 00:01:33,930
 The GDS two file has

61
00:01:34,002 --> 00:01:35,050
 already been sent for

62
00:01:35,082 --> 00:01:36,042
 fabrication.

63
00:01:36,218 --> 00:01:37,970
 A significant stride forward.

64
00:01:38,122 --> 00:01:39,370
 This will mark the creation

65
00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:40,930
 of our university's first

66
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:42,746
 ever fabricated chip.

67
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,570
 With lightning fast transmission

68
00:01:44,642 --> 00:01:46,146
 speeds, our UART

69
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,762
 transceiver ensures real

70
00:01:47,818 --> 00:01:48,850
 time communication.

71
00:01:49,002 --> 00:01:50,418
 The heart of our processor

72
00:01:50,466 --> 00:01:51,850
 lies the Matrix Mac

73
00:01:51,882 --> 00:01:53,574
 module, a revolutionary

74
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,198
 edition that revolutionizes

75
00:01:55,246 --> 00:01:56,474
 matrix manipulation.

76
00:01:56,894 --> 00:01:58,598
 It enables efficient matrix

77
00:01:58,646 --> 00:02:00,542
 operations like multiplication,

78
00:02:00,678 --> 00:02:01,694
 addition, and

79
00:02:01,734 --> 00:02:02,694
 subtraction.

80
00:02:02,854 --> 00:02:04,606
 With the Matrix Mac module,

81
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,150
 our processor transcends

82
00:02:06,182 --> 00:02:07,998
 limitations, opening doors

83
00:02:08,046 --> 00:02:09,274
 to new possibilities.

84
00:02:09,574 --> 00:02:11,550
 Our RISC five processor,

85
00:02:11,662 --> 00:02:13,158
 already capable of handling

86
00:02:13,206 --> 00:02:14,886
 over 20 instructions,

87
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,582
 now boasts an additional

88
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:18,288
 ten instructions.

89
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:19,884
 This means it can manage

90
00:02:19,964 --> 00:02:21,604
 more complex computations

91
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,412
 and tackle diverse tasks

92
00:02:23,468 --> 00:02:24,492
 with ease.

93
00:02:24,668 --> 00:02:25,892
 This and the instruction

94
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:27,260
 set is a leap forward in

95
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:28,868
 computational capability,

96
00:02:29,036 --> 00:02:30,420
 setting new standards in

97
00:02:30,452 --> 00:02:32,180
 performance and versatility.

98
00:02:32,372 --> 00:02:33,868
 But how does our processor

99
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:35,020
 orchestrate this symphony

100
00:02:35,052 --> 00:02:36,260
 of computation?

101
00:02:36,452 --> 00:02:38,100
 Instructions carefully

102
00:02:38,132 --> 00:02:39,756
 constructed travel to our

103
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,140
 UART transceiver

104
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:42,900
 receiving they land in the

105
00:02:42,932 --> 00:02:44,116
 instruction memory.

106
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,996
 The processor then executes

107
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,708
 each instruction with precision,

108
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:49,164
 guiding us to a brighter

109
00:02:49,204 --> 00:02:51,060
 future in the computing world.

110
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,164
 Our journey doesnt end here.

111
00:02:53,284 --> 00:02:54,780
 We have grand plans for the

112
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:55,388
 future.

113
00:02:55,556 --> 00:02:57,372
 We aim to convert our RISCV

114
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:59,244
 processor into a system on

115
00:02:59,284 --> 00:03:01,076
 chip, a single integrated

116
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,212
 circuit that can perform

117
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:03,852
 all the functions of a computer

118
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:04,460
 system.

119
00:03:04,612 --> 00:03:06,212
 But were not stopping there

120
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:08,044
 were also developing an online

121
00:03:08,124 --> 00:03:09,908
 simulator that will be accessible

122
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,162
 to the whole world.

123
00:03:11,308 --> 00:03:12,662
 This will allow everyone

124
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:14,646
 from students to professionals,

125
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,438
 to test our product and

126
00:03:16,486 --> 00:03:17,654
 experience its power

127
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:18,702
 firsthand.

128
00:03:18,838 --> 00:03:20,678
 So join us as we continue

129
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:21,886
 to push the boundaries of

130
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,582
 what's possible in computing,

131
00:03:23,718 --> 00:03:25,334
 and together we can shape

132
00:03:25,374 --> 00:03:26,454
 the future of this industry.
